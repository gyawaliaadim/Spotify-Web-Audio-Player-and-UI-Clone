  <br>
  <br>
Type cd "path-of-folder-containing-index.html" Like this:

<br>

You can add more Artists, Playlist etc by just going Inside albums folder and adding a folder like this:<br>
<br>
<b>Name - Type</b>
<br>
For example:
<br>
<b>The Weeknd - Artist</b> or <br>
<b>Favorites - Playlist</b> <br>
you can put all your <b> .mp3 </b> extension song files inside of it, and you can include a cover photo by adding : cover.jpg<br>
If you don't add cover.jpg, the program will automatically put a playlist img instead of the cover.
